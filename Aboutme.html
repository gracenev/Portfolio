        <p>My name is Grace Neville and I am a second year student at Western. I am currently completing my degree in Software Engineering.. For the past 16 months I have been working as an intern at an international enviornment company. That experience gave me the necessary skills to take on future school projects. In my free time I enjoy being on the executive team of the Women in Engineering Club. I hope to pursue a career in the tech industry where I can help to make technoloy benfit us in our day-to-day lives. </p>
